# DAC7678-Arduino
Full-featured Arduino library for configuring, controlling, and communicating with a TI DAC7678 chip.

The files have been uploaded to GitHub but HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED AND PROBABLY DON'T WORK. If you had the misfortune of running across this library before I finished it up, give it a few weeks and it'll be fine.
